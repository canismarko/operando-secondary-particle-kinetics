doi = {10.1149/1.057304jes}, 
abstract ={By starting from fundamental principles, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of electrodeposited anode materials is analyzed. Thermodynamically, we show that an overpotential-controlled critical radius has to be overcome in order for dendrite formation to become energetically favorable. Kinetically, surface tension and overpotential driving forces define a critical kinetic radius above which an isolated embryo will grow and below which it will shrink. As a result, five regimes of behavior are identified: nucleation suppression regime, long incubation time regime, short incubation time regime, early growth regime, and late growth regime. In the nucleation suppression regime, embryos are thermodynamically unstable and unable to persist. For small overpotentials, below a critical overpotential, 2η○, and between the thermodynamic and kinetic critical radius, a metastable regime exists where the local electrochemically enabled Gibbs-Thomson interactions control the coarsening of the embryos, thus defining the long incubation time regime. In addition, very broad nuclei size distributions are favored. For large overpotentials, above 2η○, a short incubation time regime develops as a result of the small energy barrier and large galvanostatic driving forces. In addition, very narrow size distributions of nuclei are favored. In the early growth regime, thermodynamically and kinetically favored nuclei grow to reach an asymptotic growth velocity. Finally, in the late growth regime, morphological instabilities and localized electric fields dominate the morphology and microstructural evolution of the deposit.},

abstract ={Despite the extensive commercial use of Li1-xNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) as the positive electrode in Li-ion batteries, and its long research history, its fundamental transport properties are poorly understood. These properties are crucial for designing high energy density and high power Li-ion batteries. Here, the transport properties of NCA are investigated using impedance spectroscopy and dc polarization and depolarization techniques. The electronic conductivity is found to increase with decreasing Li-content from ∼10−4 Scm−1 to ∼10−2 Scm−1 over x = 0.0 to 0.6, while lithium ion conductivity is at least five orders of magnitude lower for x = 0.0 to 0.75. A surprising result is that the lithium ionic diffusivity vs. x shows a v-shaped curve with a minimum at x = 0.5, while the unit cell parameters show the opposite trend. This suggests that cation ordering has greater influence on the composition dependence than the Li layer separation, unlike other layered oxides. From temperature-dependent measurements in electron-blocking cells, the activation energy for lithium ion conductivity (diffusivity) is found to be 1.25 eV (1.20 eV). Chemical diffusion during electrochemical use is limited by lithium transport, but is fast enough over the entire state-of-charge range to allow charge/discharge of micron-scale particles at practical C-rates.},

abstract ={Layered LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) is one of the high-energy positive electrode (cathode) materials for next generation Li-ion batteries. However, compared to the structurally similar LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC111), it can suffer from a shorter lifetime due to its higher surface reactivity. This work studied and compared the formation of surface contaminations on NMC811 and NMC111 when stored under ambient conditions using electrochemical cycling, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. NMC811 was found to develop a surface layer of up to ∼10 nm thickness that was mostly composed of nickel carbonate species mixed with minor quantities of hydroxide and water after ambient storage for 1 year, while no significant changes were observed on the NMC111 surface. The amount of carbonate species was quantified by gas chromatographic (GC) detection of carbon dioxide generated when the NMC particles were dispersed in hydrochloric acid.

A two-phase-separated state of the NCA electrodes was observed in the first charge cycle. It was established that stronger compaction of the electrodes partially suppresses the phase separation of the cathode material: reduces a state of charge (SOC) range where two phases coexist, and decreases the difference between structural parameters of the phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has revealed a presence of Li2CO3 film at the surface of the NCA material in the amount that is unlikely to affect the NCA behavior during the first charge. It was suggested that the phase-separated state is caused by the morphology of the NCA material. This observation could be expanded to layered cathode materials with similar microstructures."

abstract ={Rate capability of “diluted” electrodes composed of micron-sized particles of an active material, Li[Li0.1Al0.1Mn1.8]O4 (LAMO), and a spectator material, Al2O3, were investigated to determine the rate-limiting step during discharge accompanied with lithium insertion. Capacity retention based on the LAMO-weight specific current density (C-rate) was significantly improved by reducing LAMO contents in the diluted electrodes, whereas no significant difference was found in capacity retention based on area specific current density. These results indicate that the rate-limiting step during discharge is not Li-ion diffusion in the active materials, but the transportation of Li cations and counter anions in the electrodes. Comparison of amounts of Li+ ions inserted to LAMO during charge with that supplied from an electrolyte indicated that rate capability can be improved by increasing the amount of Li ions in the pore of the electrode. The comparison also suggests that transportation of the counter anion causing concentration overvoltage limits the rate capability.},

abstract = "Lithium-ion cells show a reversible capacity fade at low C-rates (C/10) at temperatures below T=0°C. This phenomenon cannot solely been explained by temperature induced impedance raise and the formation of solid electrolyte interphases any more. We investigate four different cell chemistries at temperatures T=25, 0, −10 and −20°C. All measurements are carried out on full cells. The activation energies and especially the ratio of anodic and cathodic activation energies have the highest impact on capacity fading at low C-rates. For quantification of the ratio, we define an activation factor between anodic and the cathodic activation energies. We derive temperature and activation energy behavior on basis of the Butler–Volmer equation for increasing internal voltages and polarization. High activation energies causes high energy demand for activation polarization and an earlier reach of cut-off voltages. If the negative and positive electrode are well balanced with respect to activation energies, the internal voltages which are induced at electrodes boundary layers (electrochemical double layer) are small and the pseudo open circuit voltages lower."

Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies have been extensively studied to utilize carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, as a resource. So far, however, effective technologies have not been proposed owing to the low efficiency conversion rate and high energy requirements. Here, we present a hybrid Na-CO2 cell that can continuously produce electrical energy and hydrogen through efficient CO2 conversion with stable operation for over 1,000 hr from spontaneous CO2 dissolution in aqueous solution. In addition, this system has the advantage of not regenerating CO2 during charging process, unlike aprotic metal-CO2 cells. This system could serve as a novel CO2 utilization technology and high-value-added electrical energy and hydrogen production device."

Here we present two approaches to visualize and quantify this detachment and use the?experimental results to develop and validate a model that considers?how the active particle size, the viscoelastic parameters of the composite electrode, the adhesion between the active particle and the carbon black-binder domain, and the solid electrolyte interphase growth rate impact detachment and capacity fade. Using carbon-silicon composite electrodes as a model system, we demonstrate X-ray nano-tomography and backscatter scanning electron microscopy with sufficient resolution and contrast to segment the pore space, active particles, and carbon black-binder domain and quantify delamination as a function of cycle number. The validated model is further used to discuss how detachment and capacity fade in high-capacity materials can be minimized through materials engineering.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen cycle and the fixation of atmospheric N2 into ammonium are crucial to global food production. The industrial Haber{\textendash}Bosch process facilitates half the global nitrogen fixation in the form of ammonia but it is energy- and resource-intensive, using natural gas as the source of energy and hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure. Our alternative approach synthesizes ammonium from N2 and H2O at ambient conditions powered by water splitting, which may be driven renewably. The inorganic{\textendash}biological hybrid system fixes atmospheric nitrogen into NH3 or soluble biomass with high fluxes and energy efficiency. Simultaneously, this system cultivates a living soil bacterium that acts as a potent biofertilizer amenable to boosting crop yields.We demonstrate the synthesis of NH3 from N2 and H2O at ambient conditions in a single reactor by coupling hydrogen generation from catalytic water splitting to a H2-oxidizing bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus, which performs N2 and CO2 reduction to solid biomass. Living cells of X. autotrophicus may be directly applied as a biofertilizer to improve growth of radishes, a model crop plant, by up to \~{}1,440\% in terms of storage root mass. The NH3 generated from nitrogenase (N2ase) in X. autotrophicus can be diverted from biomass formation to an extracellular ammonia production with the addition of a glutamate synthetase inhibitor. The N2 reduction reaction proceeds at a low driving force with a turnover number of 9 {\texttimes} 109 cell{\textendash}1 and turnover frequency of 1.9 {\texttimes} 104 s{\textendash}1.cell{\textendash}1 without the use of sacrificial chemical reagents or carbon feedstocks other than CO2. This approach can be powered by renewable electricity, enabling the sustainable and selective production of ammonia and biofertilizers in a distributed manner.},

	abstract = {Batteries based on lithium metal and oxygen could offer energy densities an order of magnitude larger than that of lithium ion cells. But, under normal operation conditions, the lithium oxidizes to form peroxide or superoxide. Xia et al. show that, at increased temperatures, the formation of lithium oxide is favored, through a process in which four electrons are transferred for each oxygen molecule (see the Perspective by Feng et al.). Reversible cycling is achieved through the use of a thermally stable inorganic electrolyte and a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.Science, this issue p. 777; see also p. 758Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries have attracted much attention owing to the high theoretical energy density afforded by the two-electron reduction of O2 to lithium peroxide (Li2O2). We report an inorganic-electrolyte Li-O2 cell that cycles at an elevated temperature via highly reversible four-electron redox to form crystalline lithium oxide (Li2O). It relies on a bifunctional metal oxide host that catalyzes O{\textendash}O bond cleavage on discharge, yielding a high capacity of 11 milliampere-hours per square centimeter, and O2 evolution on charge with very low overpotential. Online mass spectrometry and chemical quantification confirm that oxidation of Li2O involves transfer of exactly 4 e{\textendash}/O2. This work shows that Li-O2 electrochemistry is not intrinsically limited once problems of electrolyte, superoxide, and cathode host are overcome and that coulombic efficiency close to 100\% can be achieved.},

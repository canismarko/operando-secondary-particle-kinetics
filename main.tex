% NCA/NMC material
Layered transition metal oxides represent the state-of-the-art of
cathodes materials for electrochemical energy storage. In order to
meet ever more ambitious performance targets, it will be necessary to
improve their efficiency and reliability beyond current
limitations. While layered cathodes provide high theoretical capacity,
only \SI{\approx70}{\percent} is realistically achievable, with a
steeper penalty imposed at higher rates\citeme{}. This observation
points to kinetic barriers preventing full utilization of the
cathode. Careful observation of local heterogeneity, combined with
detailed simulation of the underlying electrochemical processes, can
reveal details of the kinetic factors governing these reactions,
ultimately leading to higher performing energy storage systems.

% TXM/XRD background

Synchrotron X-ray characterization provides several methods to
evaluate heterogeneity within secondary particles of layered cathode
materials. \Gls{uxrd} extends the structural characterization of
conventional \gls{xrd} with improved spatial resolution. Incoming
X-rays are focused to a sub-micron spot and scanned over individual
secondary particles. At each mapping position, the diffraction pattern
captured by an area detector provides details of the crystal
structure, such as the unit-cell parameters, which can then be related
to chemical states (e.g.\ extent of lithiation). A complementary
technique, \Gls{txm}, produces projection micrographs showing the
optical depth of the object with \SI{\approx30}{nm} spatial
resolution, depending on the instrument configuration. The tunable
nature of synchrotron X-ray sources allows micrographs of the same
field of view to be captured at several energies. To produce chemical
maps, images are collected at a range of energies spanning an X-ray
absorption edge, producing a separate spectrum for each pixel in the
field of view and, after data reduction, a chemical map with chemical
significance (e.g.\ metal oxidation states). For both techniques,
since the individual measurements are projections through the
specimen, the resulting maps show the average state through the
optical axis (perpendicular to the image plane).

The high transmission provided by hard X-rays is conducive to making
measurements inside an assembled cell (is-situ) and, ideally, while
the cell is actively cycling (operando). In addition to avoiding
relaxation effects, in-situ measurement allows the same object to be
measured repeatedly at different states of charge. Tracking the same
object during a (dis)charge cycle allows for a direct comparison
between different states of charge and provides a clearer picture of
how heterogeneity evolves.

%% NCA/NMC background

Ensemble \gls{xrd} has shown a mixture of phases in \nca{} electrodes
during the first charge when stored in ambient conditions, in contrast
with the solid-solution, single-phase transformation seen during
subsequent charge cycles\cite{robert2015}. A possible origin is the
presence of a lithium diffusion barrier arising from surface
\ce{Li2CO3} formation upon exposure to \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O} (Figure
\ref{fig:grenier2017}). When pristine \nca{} was protected from
ambient air exposure, a single-phase solid-solution reaction was
observed during first charge. This observation led to the conclusion
that the secondary particles contained an uneven coating of
\ce{Li2CO3}, which must be broken electrochemically before the
reaction can proceed. The need to break this coating would produce
different timelines for reaction initiation in different particles,
resulting in a bimodal distribution of oxidation states and the
appearance of non-equilibrium heterogeneity by
\gls{xrd}\cite{grenier2017}.

The oxidation states of individual secondary particles were measured
by operando \gls{txm} \gls{xas} and, indeed, particles were observed
to be either in a pristine or partially oxidized state with more
particles becoming oxidized at higher states of
charge\cite{nowack2016}. While \ce{Li2CO3} clearly plays a role in the
ability of lithium to penetrate into the secondary particle, it was
also demonstrated that the presence of two phases by \gls{xrd} is
suppressed by stronger compaction of the electrode during laminate
preparation\cite{bobrikov2018}. A related layered cathode material,
\nmc[333]{}, is less prone to \ce{Li2CO3} formation, even showing
lower levels of \ce{Li2CO3} after one month of air exposure than those
found in pristine \nca{}\cite{shizuka2007}. In-situ \gls{xrd} studies
of \nmc[333]{} during first charge show a largely single-phase
(solid-solution) transformation \cite{hulzen2018,ahn2017,zhou2016-2},
though some studies reveal two crystallographic phases with a small
difference in \emph{a} and \emph{c} unit-cell parameters and
coexisting over a narrow range of delithiation compared to
\nca{}\cite{yoon2006,hua2018}. The oxidation dynamics of these layered
cathode materials warrant further study to clarify the nature of the
chemical transformation, especially in view of locating the onset and
progression of heterogeneity, within and between the secondary
particles that typically compose a cathode. It is important to
elucidate how general this behavior is among the general class of
layered oxides that are leading candidates as battery materials.

This work further examined the heterogeneities present in secondary
particles of established layered cathode materials, namely \nca{},
\nmc[333]{}, and \nmc[532]{}. A combination of operando \gls{uxrd} and
\gls{txm} \gls{xas} experiments probed both the inter-particle
heterogeneity. While the cell potential and prior reports of ensemble
\gls{xas} indicated a smooth transition to higher oxidation state upon
delithiation\cite{deb2005,muto2009}, individual particles exhibited a
sharp and stochastic transition from an initial, latent state to one
containing highly oxidized \ce{Ni}. \todo{Summarize the simulations.}

%% \subsection{\Gls{uxrd} - Interparticle Dynamics}

Lithiation of several secondary particles of \nca{} was tracked during
first change and discharge using operando \gls{uxrd} mapping. For each
particle, the individual area diffraction patterns collected at each
X--Y mapping position were integrated to one-dimensional patterns, and
subsequently summed for all points collected during the reaction
(Figures \ref{fig:uxrd}a,b and \ref{fig:xrd-echem}). The diffraction
patterns for all three particles in the pristine condition were
consistent with those previously reported for \nca{}
\cite{Robert2015a}. There was an extra feature that varied in
intensity at Q\SI{\approx3.6}{\per\angstrom}, representative of
metallic \ce{Li} (PDF \#00-001-1131). Small extraneous peaks occurred
due to random aberrations in individual pixels on the diffraction
detector (Figure \ref{fig:xrd-echem}).

The diffraction peaks for \gls{p1} began to shift in $Q$ soon after
the onset of oxidation (Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}a). The shifts observed
in \gls{p1} were consistent with similar observations of
\emph{operando} \gls{xrd} of the ensemble average\cite{Robert2015}, as
opposed to individual particles in \nca{} electrodes, in prior
work\cite{Grenier2017}. \gls{p2} (\ref{fig:xrd-echem}b) also exhibited
changes in peak positions during cycling. While the peak positions of
the extreme states (pristine, charged, discharged) were consistent
with those of \gls{p1}, the peaks did not begin shifting until the
cell had reached a higher potential \SI{\approx4.5}{\volt}. During
discharge, peaks in both \gls{p1} and \gls{p2} shifted to lower $Q$ at
approximately the same rate. \gls{p3} (\ref{fig:xrd-echem}c) showed no
apparent changes in diffraction peak positions during charge or
discharge, possibly due to poor electrical connection to the carbon
and binder of the electrode.

Consideration of individual peaks provided more detailed structural
information. The (003) reflection showed an initial decrease in $Q$
(Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}a), representing an expansion of the $c$ axis
due to stacking of the alternating transition metal and lithium
layers\citeme{}. The initial decrease in $Q$ was followed by a sudden
increase in $Q$ beyond the initial state, indicating contraction of
the lattice along the $c$ axis during delithiation. This trend has
been reported before. The initial expansion is attributed to
electrostatic repulsion between \ce{O^{2-}} ions in neighboring layers
once the shielding effect of deintercalated \ce{Li+} ions is no longer
present\cite{Robert2015}. In turn, the subsequent collapse is driven
by steric effects, and reflects the near complete removal of \ce{Li+}
ions, which previously acted as pillars in the layered
framework. Simultaneously, the (104) diffraction peak gradually
shifted to higher $Q$ (lower $d$) upon removal of \ce{Li} from the
material (Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}b). This shift reflected the balance
between the trend along $c$ and the continuous decrease in the $a$
dimension. In this case, the decrease was attributed to the shortening
of metal--oxygen distances due to the oxidation of the transition
metal ions (mainly \ce{Ni}), resulting in smaller ionic radii.

Unit cell parameters for each particle were refined from diffraction
patterns using the Le Bail method, and plotted as a function of cell
potential for \gls{p1} and \gls{p2} (Figures \ref{fig:uxrd}d and
\ref{fig:cell-pars}). The refined unit cell parameters matched the
qualitative trends described above in Figures \ref{fig:uxrd}a,b and
\ref{fig:xrd-echem}, as well as measurements of the ensemble average
of an electrode available in the literature\cite{Robert2015a}. The
cell parameters for \gls{p1} began shifting at a cell potential
somewhere between \SIrange{3.0}{3.8}{\volt} (Figure
\ref{fig:uxrd}d). The precise value is unknown since the temporal
resolution of the experiment was insufficient to capture a full map
during the rapid increase in potential at the beginning of charge. The
unit cell parameters for \gls{p2} began shifting at
\SI{\approx4.5}{\volt} (\ref{fig:cell-pars}c,d), consistent with the
peak shifts in \ref{fig:xrd-echem}b. These results led to the
qualitative conclusion that the rates of delithiation of each
individual particle were different and not uniquely represented by the
electrochemical response collected for the whole electrode.

%% \subsection{u-XRD - Rates of (De)lithiation}

The rate of delithiation can be quantified by estimating the amount of
\ce{Li} present in the material at different points during cathode
oxidation based on unit-cell parameters reported for ensemble-average
\gls{xrd} in Robert \emph{et al}\cite{Robert2015}. In this reference
study, \nca{} was cycled twice with a cutoff potential of
\SI{4.8}{\volt} and the cell parameters were associated with the
average \ce{Li} content in the material based on coulometric
calculations. During the first cycle, the overall \nca{} electrode
underwent a heterogeneous transformation driven by kinetic limitations
due to the presence of \ce{Li2CO3}, which is electronically
insulating, on the particle surfaces. \ce{Li2CO3} is oxidized to
\ce{CO2} during this first charge. As a result, in the second cycle,
the electrode transformed via the expected solid-solution pathway. We
compared our data to the second cycle from the work by Robert et al.,
since we did not see any evidence of heterogeneity in either the
electrochemistry or diffraction of individual particles
(\ref{fig:xrd-echem}). In order to directly compare trends in \ce{Li}
content, the experimental unit cell parameters were adjusted to ensure
agreement between the pristine state presented here first value for
the second charge of the reference data presented by Roberts et al.,
accounting for scalar discrepancies in the measurement.

Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}e shows the \ce{Li} content in \nca{x} as a
function of time during the first charge-discharge cycle, based on the
measured change in \emph{c} parameter. Similar trends were observed
when calculating \ce{Li} content using the \emph{a} parameter (Figure
\ref{fig:rates}). To allow for easier comparison between experiments
and simulation, lithiation was shown as a ratio of time passed to the
total time to reach the cutoff potential ($t_c$). This measure is
sensitive to experimental conditions, such as the choice of cut-off
potential, and so absolute comparisons are only valid within an
experiment. For both \gls{p1} and \gls{p2} the rate of delithiation
was initially slow, followed by a sudden increase (Figure
\ref{fig:uxrd}e). In the case of \gls{p1}, the delithiation during the
first \SI{0.05}{t_c} proceeded at \SI{\approx0.025}{\ce{Li}\per\hour},
or C/40, followed by a deceleration until \SI{0.2}{t_c} passed. After
this period, the overall content of the particle was
\ce{Li_{0.88}Ni_{0.80}Co_{0.15}Al_{0.05}O2}. At this point, the
reaction dramatically accelerated nearly 10-fold from the initial
rate, to \SI{\approx0.3}{\ce{Li}\per\hour}, or C/3.33 until an average
composition \nca{0.53} where the rate decelerated again until the sign
of the current was reverted. In the case of \gls{p2} there was very
little delithiation for the first \SI{0.8}{t_c}. Delithiation
proceeded down to an average content of \nca{0.92} at
\SI{\approx0.03}{\ce{Li}\per\hour}, or C/33, followed by a 20-fold
increase in rate, to \SI{\approx0.66}{\ce{Li}\per\hour}, or
C/1.5. When an average composition \nca{0.53} was again reached, the
reaction slowed down, running below \SI{0.1}{\ce{Li}\per\hour}, or
C/10, for the remainder of the oxidation. Particles relithiated
rapidly during cell discharge, with no periods of slow activity. The
states that were captured showed faster rates of relithiation earlier
in the discharge for both \gls{p1} and \gls{p2}, rivaling the fastest
rates at intermediate contents of \ce{Li} in \nca{x}, qualitatively
consistent with the oxidation. \todo{I don't understand this last
  sentence}

%% \subsection{TXM - \nmc{}}

%% \subsubsection{\nmc[333]{} Inter-particle Dynamics}

\Gls{txm} \gls{xas} was also used to characterize \nca{} secondary
particles during charge, providing a direct, spatially resolved probe
of \ce{Ni} oxidation states. Dilute (\SI{20}{\percent}) \nca{}
electrodes were assembled in modified coin-cells, and operando
\gls{txm} \gls{xas} frame-sets were collected during the first
galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle (Figure
\ref{fig:txm-nca}). Localized \gls{xas} K-edge spectra were produced
from operando \gls{txm} frame-sets and then averaged over all pixels
in secondary particle agglomerates. A \gls{txm} frame showing several
particles in a field of view is shown in Figure \ref{txm-nca}a. Upon
delithiation, a progressive increase was seen in the energy of the
absorption edge and the associated whiteline (Figures
\ref{fig:isobestic-point} and \ref{fig:kedges}). Ideally, chemically
pure reference samples are prepared for the two chemical end-members,
and the observed spectra analyzed by linear combination fitting of the
two reference spectra, as is done for
\ce{LiFePO4}\cite{wanli2016}. However, the absence of a miscibility
gap for layered cathodes prevents the preparation of chemically pure
reference samples. Instead, a more direct approach is used. For
layered transition-metal oxide cathodes, the energy of maximum
absorbance, or whiteline, of the \ce{Ni} K-edge increases as
\ce{Ni^{3+}} oxidizes to \ce{Ni^{4+}}. Therefore, whiteline energy was
used as a proxy for \ce{Ni} oxidation, which is the dominant redox
process in \nca{}.

Fields of view containing multiple secondary particles were selected
from within the coin-cell window (Figure \ref{fig:txm-nca}a), allowing
comparison of the dynamics between separate particles. Additionally,
several cells were prepared at select states of delithiation and
measured by ex-situ ensemble \gls{xas} (Figure
\ref{fig:txm-nca}c). This allowed a comparison between whiteline
position and average state-of-charge for each particle as a function
of time (Figure \ref{fig:txm-nca}d). Initially, the whiteline energies
were constant, indicating no \ce{Ni} oxidation. After
\SIrange{0.4}{0.6}{t_c}, the whiteline energies increased rapidly,
reaching \SIrange{75}{100}{\percent} state-of-charge. Although some
particles oxidized simultaneously with one another, there was no clear
preference for when particles began rapid oxidation. Not all of the
particles measured reached the full \SI{100}{\percent}
state-of-charge. Additionally, upon reaching full their maximum
state-of-charge, some particles subsequently exhibited \ce{Ni}
reduction, presumably due to oxygen loss resulting in conversion to a
cubic rock-salt-like phase\citeme{}. This stochastic particle-level
behavior was in contrast with the that seen by in-situ
ensemble-average \gls{xas}\cite{deb2005}, which showed a gradual
increase in whiteline position over the full range of
delithiation. Overall, this inter-particle rapid oxidation was in
agreement with the observations made by \gls{uxrd} described above
(Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}).

%% \subsubsection{\nmc[532]{}}

To evaluate the similarity in the oxidation behavior of \nca{} other
layered cathode compositions, similar \gls{txm} \gls{xas} experiments
were performed on cells containing dilute \nmc[333]{} and \nmc[532]{}
layered cathodes (Figure \ref{fig:txm-nmc}). Compared to \nca{}
(Figure \ref{fig:txm-nca}a), \nmc{} particle were less spherical in
shape (Figures \ref{fig:txm-nmc}a and \ref{}). Since no
ensemble-average measurements were performed, the mean optical depth
for all foreground pixels in the frame was used for evaluating overall
oxidation (Figures \ref{fig:txm-nmc}b,c). Similarly to \nca{}, spectra
for both \nmc{} cathodes showed an increase in the whiteline
energy. \nmc[333]{} exhibited a lower initial whiteline energy. The
\ce{Mn{3+}/Mn{4+}} redox couple has a higher reduction potential than
the \ce{Ni{2+}/Ni{3+}} couple, which resulted in the spontaneous
formation of \ce{Ni^{2+}} limited by the concentration of manganese
(lower in the case of \nmc[532]). Rather than calculate an average
state-of-charge, as was done when ensemble-average spectra were
available (Figure \ref{txm-nca}d), whiteline energies were compared to
the lowest value observed for any particle in the field of view during
the operando experiment, reported here as \textDelta{}whiteline. A
parametric function was fit to each pixel's full spectrum, and the
whiteline energies were extracted from the fit parameters. This
approach provided higher precision and was more tolerant of noise
between frames, allowing for faster time resolution. For both \nmc{}
materials, the same initial latent phase and subsequent rapid
oxidation were seen (Figures \ref{fig:txm-nmc}d,e). The initial rapid
\ce{Ni} oxidation resulted in changes in whiteline energy for
\nmc[333] of \SI{\approx3}{\electronvolt} and \nmc[532]{} of
\SI{\approx2.5}{\electronvolt}, reflecting the lower starting
concentration of \ce{Ni^{2+}} in \nmc[532]{}. The experiment using
\nmc[532]{} did not reach the same overall state of charge. For
\nmc[333]{}, once rapid oxidation had occurred, a subsequent gradual
increase to \SI{4.1}{eV} was observed for \nmc[333]{}. The total
change in whiteline energy for all observed secondary particles was
\SI{>4}{eV} (Figure \ref{fig:txm-nmc}d). While ensemble \gls{xas}
studies\cite{deb2005,muto2009} did not reach the \SI{4.7}{V} cell
cut-off potential needed for full lithium extraction and hence full
\ce{Ni} oxidation, extrapolation of the trend in Table
\ref{tab:bulk-xas-extraction} and Figure
\ref{fig:bulk-xas-extraction}a predicts a change in whiteline energy
upon full delithiation of \SI{\approx3}{eV}. This discrepancy between
particle-level and ensemble average \ce{Ni} oxidation suggests that an
appreciable portion of the particles in the specimens measured by
ensemble \gls{xas} had not reached their fully oxidized states.

\todo{Do we want to discuss the relationship between rapid oxidation and the e-chem kink?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\gls{p1} and \gls{p2} both achieved the same level of delithiation at
the end of the charge sequence, observed in Figure \ref{fig:uxrd}e and
by the peak positions in Figures \ref{fig:uxrd}a,b and
\ref{fig:ind-peaks}. Since \gls{p2} did not start delithiating until
late in the charge sequence, its maximum rate of delithiation was more
than double that of \gls{p1}. This observation has no precedent in the
literature for reactions involving solid solutions, where homogeneity
removes the activation barrier toward nucleation of two-phase
mechanisms. It is particularly intriguing considering that the whole
electrode was discharged at a low constant current. It can be
hypothesized that it is due to subtle variations in overpotential
between particles as a result of a different connectivity with the
electrical circuit through the carbon additive (electrons) and the
pores that contain electrolyte (ions). Particle size may have also had
an impact. Since \gls{p2} was approximately half the size of \gls{p1},
the \ce{Li} diffusion lengths out of the particle would have been
shorter. Neither of these explanations is satisfactory to predict the
change in rate for an individual particle. It is worth noting that the
changes happen at approximately similar \ce{Li} contents for both
particles studied, suggesting that the oxidation of the material
changes its physical properties, such as electronic and ionic
conductivity. Follow-up experiments are needed to evaluate this
point. Both particles relithiated to \nca{x}, where $x$ was between
\numrange{0.88}{0.97}.

\subsection{\gls{uxrd} Mapping}

The \nca{} composite electrode tape was cast in a dry room (dew point
of \SI{<-35}{\celsius}) using the Bellcore method
\cite{Tarascon1996}. A mixture of \nca{}, poly(vinylidene
fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP, Kynar 2801, Elf Atochem),
carbon black (Super P, MMM), propylene carbonate (Aldrich), and
acetone (Aldrich) was used for the casting slurry. After casting, the
tape was allowed to dry in air, and then the propylene carbonate
plasticizer was extracted by soaking the tape in 99.8\% anhydrous
diethyl ether (Aldrich). The electrode tape had a mass composition of
\SI{20}{\percent} active material, \SI{20}{\percent} carbon additive,
and \SI{60}{\percent} binder. Prior to storage in the Ar-filled
glovebox, the tape was dried under vacuum at \SI{120}{\celsius}
overnight.

The AMPIX electrochemical cell was utilized to allow X-ray penetration
through the electrode \cite{borkiewicz2012}. Lithium metal was used as
the counter electrode and the electrolyte was composed of 1M
\ce{LiPF6} in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate:dimethyl
carbonate. Glass fiber served as the separator.

Diffraction maps were collected at the microprobe beamline at sector
34 at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL). An incoming monochromatic beam at \SI{25}{\kilo\electronvolt}
(\SI{0.4959}{\angstrom}) with a size of approximately \num{0.5} x
\SI{0.5}{\micro\meter} was shone through the AMPIX cell onto the
sample. The intensity of the diffracted beam was collected in
transmission geometry by a MAR165 CCD detector, with 4096 x 4096
pixels, each measuring \SI{40}{\square\micro\meter}, used in 2 x 2
binning mode.

Particle locations were determined through absorption contrast imaging
over the \ce{Ni K_\alpha} emission line at
\SI{\approx8}{\kilo\electronvolt}. Once particles were located, the
sample was moved relative to the beam using a step size of
\SI{1}{\micro\meter} and an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\second}. Two-dimensional diffraction maps were collected in
this manner continuously over the charge-discharge cycle. At each
exposure, or mapping position, a single full 2D diffraction pattern,
averaging over the depth of the material, was collected (an example is
seen in \ref{fig:2Ddiffraction}). After one map was collected for each
particle, a positive current was applied so that the charge rate would
be c/20 (in which removal of a full \ce{Li} equivalent would complete
in \SI{20}{\hour}). The cut-off potential for the cell was set for
\SI{4.8}{\volt}, to ensure a complete oxidation of the \nca{}. After
holding the cell near \SI{4.8}{\volt} for several hours, the cell was
discharged at a negative current equal in magnitude to that of the
charge. The data was collected using EPICS channel-access data
acquisition and control software.

The 2D diffraction data collected by the beamline was integrated using
the FIT2D software package developed by ESRF \cite{Hammersley1996,
  Hammersley1997}. The integrated data was processed with the Scimap
analysis package \cite{Wolfman2015}, in which the determination of the
peak position yielded a set of unit cell parameters for each mapping
position, which were plotted using Python. An ensemble diffraction
pattern for each particle at each state of charge was obtained by
summing the patterns at each mapping position. These patterns
underwent batch Le Bail refinement by the TOPAS software developed by
Bruker to produce plots of unit cell as a function of charge-discharge
for each particle as a whole.

\nca{} (NAT-1050), \nmc[333]{} (NM-3100) and \nmc[532]{} (NCM-045T)
were purchased from TODA America, Inc.\ and either stored under

assembled in these modified coin-cell parts with \SI{1}{M} \ce{LiPF6}
in 1:1 EC/DMC electrolyte and \SI{12.7}{\milli\meter} diameter \ce{Li}
metal anode inside an argon-filled glovebox. Once crimped, holes in
coin-cell were covered with \SI{1}{\micro\meter} thick \ce{Si3N4}
windows (Norcada NX5200F) using Torr-Seal vacuum-rated
epoxy. Assembled and sealed cells were removed from the glovebox and
mounted in the X-ray microscope.

\gls{txm} was performed at either the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Lightsource beamline 6-2c (Figures \ref{fig:nca-particles},
\ref{fig:nca-discharge-features} and \ref{fig:nca-line-scan}) or the
Advanced Photon Source beamline 8-BM-B (Figures
\ref{fig:nmc-particles}, \ref{fig:nmc-maps},
\ref{fig:nmc-maps-discharge}, \ref{fig:nca-irradiation},
\ref{fig:nmc532-particles}, and \ref{fig:nmc532-maps}), both equipped
with an XRadia transmission microscope. Beamline 6-2c utilizes a
56-pole, 0.9-Tesla Wiggler with 1.2 mrad acceptance focused and
\num{\approx1e-4} energy resolution ($\frac{\Delta E}{E}$). A
\SI{60}{nm} outer-zone-width objective zone-plate was used to render a
magnified image on a $2048 \times 2048$ charge-coupled device with
binning factor 2, producing $1024 \times 1024$ intensity
images. Beamline 8-BM-B utilizes a bending magnet source. The
remaining optical setup is similar to beamline 6-2c.

Operando data acquisition was performed by collecting frames at each
energy of both the specimen and a reference frame with no cell or
sample in the field of view. Image processing was performed using the
xanespy package\cite{xanespy}. Optical depth (OD) images were
calculated from the object frame ($I$) and reference frame ($I_0$) as
$$OD = \log{\big(\frac{I_0}{I}\big)}$$ All images within a full
operando experiment were aligned using multiple passes (as needed) of
the \texttt{register\_translation} function provided by
scikit-image\cite{walt2014} using the mean optical-depth frame as the
target image. Image normalization was performed on each frame by
subtracting the median optical depIt's all under version control, so whether you use tracked changes is
up to you.
th of all background pixels
(determined by thresholding using Otsu's method\cite{otsu1979}) of
that frame\cite{jin2015}. Pixels not containing an appreciable level
of \ce{Ni} spectral signal were masked by calculating the ratio of the
edge jump (difference between the post-edge and pre-edge optical
depths) to the standard deviation of the optical depth spectrum. This
ratio was calculated for the whole frame-set, then a threshold for the
mask was determined using Otsu's method\cite{otsu1979} through
scikit-image\cite{walt2014}. Spectra for pixels passing this edge
filter were then fit with a linear combination of a background line,
Gaussian peak and arctangent function:

\begin{equation}
  OD(E) = t + s\bigg[\frac{1}{\pi}\arctan(\sigma (E-E_0)) + \frac{1}{2} +
    a\mathrm{e}^{\frac{-(E-E_0-b)^2}{2c^2}} + m(E-E_0)\bigg]
  \label{eq:kedge-fitting}
\end{equation}

with fitting parameters $\sigma$ to control the width of the
arctangent edge jump; $a, b, c$ to control the height, position and
width of the Gaussian whiteline peak; $m$ to control the slope of the
background; $E_0$ to represent the absolute energy of the edge; and
$s, t$ to control the overall scale and vertical offset of the
spectrum. Fitting was performed with the
\texttt{scipy.optimize.leastsq} wrapper around the MINPACK
\texttt{lmdif} routine\cite{scipy}. Whiteline positions were extracted
by re-sampling the above parametric function with 200 energies and
selecting the energy of maximum optical depth. Plotting was performed
using matplotlib\cite{matplotlib}.

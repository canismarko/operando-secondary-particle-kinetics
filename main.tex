(A) Isolated 2nd particle in the FoV. The crack (indicated as red
arrow) suddenly appeared at the SoC VI (same sudden ``jumps'' position
in Jordi's e-mail). (B) Geometrical scaling factor with respect to
global SoCs. At ‘jump’ position, the volumes (1-dimensional scaling
factor \textasciicircum3) of the 2nd particles shrank around 3\%. The 1-dimensional
scaling factor was calculated by intensity-based image registration of
identical particles with respect to different SoCs. The enhance
robustness of analysis, 1-dimensional scaling factors were calculated
at all energy points (I don't remember exact the number of points but
it should be 30 ~ 40 points. Need to revisit the data) in imagespectra
and STD of the calculated 1-dimensional scaling factors\^{}3 shown as
error bars.  The shrinkage of the 2nd particles is smaller that
crystallographic volume shrinkage of the unit cell (I don't remember
exact number.) and cause the empty space inside (means microstructural
defaces such as void and crack).  (C) and (D) Chemical heterogeneity
of 2nd particle -> As Jordi mentioned, they are not the important
point. : )

(E) Averaged SoC of each 2nd particle with respect to global
SoCs. The positions of ``jump'' are differed.  The definition of
several SoC 1. Global SoC -> SoC of the entire in-situ cell (shown
in Figure 3B) 2. SoC or averaged SoC -> SoC of each individual 2nd
particle.
